# Regression and T-tests on climate data
This project is about t-tests and regression performed on the climate dataset.
This dataset has 7804 observations and 24 variables.
The highest temperature is about 80Â°F especially in the month of August.
The highest heat index isrecorded in the western region.
The maximum pressure is recorded in the northern and southern region and the lowest pressure is recorded
in the central and western region.
There is a considerable disparity in the sample mean temperature and actual mean temperature.
There is a considerable disparity in the mean rainfall in the eastern and western regions. The mean rainfall
in the eastern region is 6.24 in, while the mean rainfall in the western region is 5.47 in. The gap in their
rainfall can range from 0.45 to 1.1 in.
There is a considerable disparity in the mean humidity in the months of April and August. The mean
humidity in the month of April is estimated as 78.1%, while the mean humidity in the month of August is
estimated as 82%.
The average dewpoint and average temperature has the highest positive correlation.
As the temperature increases, the humidity decreases.
As the temperature increases, the rainfall also increases.
As the pressure increases, the heat decreases.
As the windspeed increases, the temperature decreases in the southern part.
